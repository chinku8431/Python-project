# BloodDonorSystem

Objective:



	The objective is to develop a system through which a user can communicate and access information about a particular blood donors or blood providing organizations.
	we maintain the centralized database to preserve the  details of the blood donors and organizations. Through our website we can give the suggestions to the particular donor or organizations. Our website also provides any common people to join as a donor .

Existing System

	In present system it is difficult to coordinate  the details of a blood donors or any blood providing organizations.
	Often to get the details of the donors or any blood providing organizations we have to go for the manually or we have to search in the magzines but it is time consuming process and takes the much effort also, so we can’t get the details of donors or organizations with in a quick time

Limitations in Existing System :

•	Often to get the details of the donors or any blood providing organizations we have to go for the manually.
•	Its depends on the know persons only

Proposed System:

	The proposed system maintains a centrelaised database to store information related to blood donors and blood providing organizations
	The system maintains means it coordinates the details of donors and organizations at one place.
	The system allows one to access the information about the particular donors or organizations. Nonusers can interact with our system and they can get the details of the donors and organizations. Through our system the nonuser can also become as a donor. 

Study of the system:
To provide flexibility to the users, the interfaces have been developed that are accessible through a browser. The GUI’S at the top level have been categorized as
1.	Administrative user interface
2.	The operational or generic user interface

The ‘administrative user interface’ concentrates on the consistent information that is practically, part of the organizational activities and which needs proper authentication for the data collection. These interfaces help the administrators with all the transactional states like Data insertion, Data deletion and Date updation along with the extensive data search capabilities.

The ‘operational or generic user interface’ helps the end users of the system in transactions through the existing data and required services. The operational user interface also helps the ordinary users in managing their own information in a customized manner as per the included flexibilities.

Feasibility Study:

Feasibility Report:

Preliminary investigation examines project feasibility, the likelihood the system will be useful to the organization. The main objective of the feasibility study is to test the Technical, Operational and Economical feasibility for adding new modules and debugging old running system. All systems are feasible if they are given unlimited resources and infinite time. There are aspects in the feasibility study portion of the preliminary investigation:
•	Technical Feasibility
•	Operation Feasibility
•	Economical Feasibility




Technical Feasibility: 
The technical issue usually raised during the feasibility stage of the investigation includes the following:
•	Does the necessary technology exist to do what is suggested?
•	Do the proposed equipments have the technical capacity to hold the data required to use the new system?
•	Will the proposed system provide adequate response to inquiries, regardless of the number or location of users?
•	Can the system be upgraded if developed?
•	Are there technical guarantees of accuracy, reliability, ease of access and data security?
 

Operational Feasibility:
Proposed projects are beneficial only if they can be turned out into information systems, which will meet the organization’s operating requirements. Operational feasibility aspects of the project are to be taken as an important part of the project implementation. Some of the important issues raised are to test the operational feasibility of a project includes the following: -
•	Is there sufficient support for the management from the users?
•	Will the system be used and work properly if it is being developed and implemented?
•	Will there be any resistance from the user that will undermine the possible application benefits?
This system is targeted to be in accordance with the above-mentioned issues. Beforehand, the management issues and user requirements have been taken into consideration. So there is no question of resistance from the users that can undermine the possible application benefits.
The well-planned design would ensure the optimal utilization of the computer resources and would help in the improvement of performance status.

Economic Feasibility:
A system can be developed technically and that will be used if installed must still be a good investment for the organization. In the economical feasibility, the development cost in creating the system is evaluated against the ultimate benefit derived from the new systems. Financial benefits must equal or exceed the costs. The system is economically feasible. It does not require any additional hardware or software.  

Functional Requirements:
MODULES
	(1)Administrator.
	(2)Donor.
	(3)Organizations.
	(4)NonUser.
(1)Administrator:
	The entire application will be maintained by the Administrator. He can only add the New States, New Cities, New Blood Groups and Organizations into Blood Donor Portal. He can view the all details of the donors and organiations and he can also send the suggestions to both of the donors and organizations. He can update, delete the profile details of the website. The Administrator will give the permissions for donors and organizations to login into our website.

(2)Donor:
	The Donor is a person that who is ready to donate the blood, so first he has to be register in Blood Donor Portal by specifying his name, contact number, bloodgroup and last donation date etc. He can view the suggestions of admin and the other donors in the Portal that which are send to him. He can also send the suggestions to the Admin and other Donors.

(3)Organizations:
	If any Organization want to give the existence to the people those who need the blood then the Organization must interact with the Administrator, so the Administrator will provide the Id and Pwd to particular Organization by adding it into Blood Donor Portal website. 
	Here the Organizations are that may be a Hospitals, BloodBanks and Clinics which are involved in our application. Our website maintains the all details of the Organizations. By these the non-user can easily find out the details of the particular organizations and later he can contact with the organizations by their details.

(4)Non-User:
	 The Non-User is the person that who needs the blood . The Non-User can search the Blood Donor By specifying proper State, City and the Blood Group in our Website.
	He can also search any organizations like Hospitals, BloodBanks and Clinics by specifying the  their details. If the Non-User want to become as a donor then he can register into our website. The Non-User can be send any quire’s to the Administrator.
